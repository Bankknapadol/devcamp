            Passionate about leveraging my diverse background to embark on a career in cloud computing and technology.
            As an AWS re/Start graduate, I've honed my skills in cloud computing, and I'm eager to apply them in
            real-world scenarios.
            My experience as a Barista and Customer Service Manager has taught me the value of exceptional
            communication, adaptability, and customer-centricity. These skills, coupled with my academic foundation in
            Economics and Mass Communication, with a major in Public Relations & Advertising, provide a unique blend of
            technical and soft skills.
            I'm committed to continuous learning and excited to contribute to projects that drive innovation in cloud
            technology. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate and grow together.
